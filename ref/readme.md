*Reference documents*

To minimize total repository size and respect potentially incongruous terms of 
redistribution, copies of documentation produced by third-parties are not
checked into this repository. However, all sources are/were available on the 
public Internet. To retrieve third-party documentation, either:

  1.  Manually visit the URLs listed in the plain-text document `_sources.txt`
  2.  Run the Python script `_fetch.py` with the plain-text document as its
      single argument. 
      * On Windows machines, drag-n-dropping `_sources.txt` onto `_fetch.py` is
        generally sufficient. 
      * On other platforms, it may need to be explicitly specified: 
        `python _fetch.py _sources.txt`

The document `_sources.txt` contains many lines of url/file name pairs. To be
parsed correctly: (1) only a single pair is allowed per line and (2) the file
name must follow the URL separated by *precisely* four spaces. Blank lines and
comments (lines beginning with `#`) are ignored.
