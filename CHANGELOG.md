Change Log for GHG Monitoring Tower Program
===========================================

Next release
------------

> Previous telemetry integrations (email, ScadaBR) have been removed in this
> version.

### Data Table Changes

* Remove 5-min flux/met and soil data tables
* Remove references to Picarro or Los Gatos instruments from `extra_info` table
* Remove conditionally-included data table `tsdata_extra`
* Fix issue which caused column `hfp_installed` in data table `site_info` to
  always be false

### Instrumentation Changes

* Remove soil temp/moisture probes (8x Decagon Devices 5TM)
* Change soil temperature probes in layer above soil heat flux plates 
  (2x CSI model 109 probes &rarr; 1x CSI averaging thermocouple)
* Remove prototype NDVI/PRI sensors (Decagon Devices)
* Change PAR sensor back to LI190SB with Campbell Scientific-specific cabling
  (versus Licor direct-purchase LI190R unit)

### Other changes

* Remove scheduled reporting to ScadaBR instance
* Remove automated email reporting
* Improved settings menu provides guidance on units where appropriate


v1.2 (2015-07-28)
-----------------

### Issues Fixed

* Correct multiplier used to determine total PAR flux:
    * Only total flux, not flux density was affected
    * Multiplier was 10x too small
    * Issue has existed since initial deployment (surfaced in fc4c5d446c)
* Correct regression introduced by 1176377a2d (introduced in v1.0): 
  variable `skipped_5s_scans` reflects reporting scan, not soil (5sec) scan
* ScadaBR reports are no longer malformed (caused by incorrect parameter type)
* Correctly detect success of ScadaBR reports - O/S (CR3000.Std.27) has bug
  whereby HTTP GET responses with empty payloads are wrongly interpreted as
  failures
* ScadaBR test-trigger variable is relocated to end of Public table

### Data Table Changes

* New column `LI190R_mult` after `LI190SB_sens` in table `site_info`. The old
  column is retained to distinguish the values and for backward-compatibility 
  with REACCH processing scripts

### Instrumentation Changes

* PAR sensor (LI190SB) with faults in cable is replaced with equivalent model 
  equipped with different shunt resistor (LI190R-SMV); now, settings specify
  sensor multiplier (mmol/s/m^2/mV) instead of sensitivity. 

### Enhancements

* ScadaBR test-trigger variable is not reset until test request is completed

### Other Changes

* Destination test variable in ScadaBR renamed `testlisten` -> `testing`


v1.1 (2015-06-19)
-----------------

### Issues Fixed

* Update email settings file instructions to reflect f11ee6a626 [Encrypt email
  settings before deployment]

### Enhancements

* Trigger test emails via Public table by changing `test_email` to "true"; 
  SMTP server responses can be viewed in `debug` table. Same functionality as
  provided by debug menu


v1.0.1 (2015-05-09)
-------------------

### Issues Fixed

* Use min/max battery & temperature data from `site_daily` table, as intended,
  instead of -7999/PanelTemp/Battery values in daily update email

### Data Table Changes

* New column `GitRepoTag` in the `site_info` table, after `ProgSig`


v1.0 (2015-05-08)
-----------------

> <div style="border: 1px solid red; padding: 4px">**Security advisement**  
> A minimum of level 1 datalogger security is **required** for safe operation
> of this program. If no security level is set, potentially catastropohic
> changes can be made by anonymous users![^1]</div>

  [^1]: In reality, seriously damaging changes can be made by anonymous users
        even in previous versions; however, with this release *only* settings
        and debug values are exposed in the Public table and the risk of
        unintentional changes is higher.

> <div style="border: 1px solid red; padding: 4px">**New include file**  
> Before deployment, an encrypted version of the email include file **must** 
> be stored on the logger's `CPU` drive.</div>

> <div style="border: 1px solid red; padding: 4px">**Incompatible settings file**  
> After deployment, program settings must be **completely reset** before
> reprogramming with site-specific values.</div>


### Known Issues

* *Required actions before deployment*
    * Enable datalogger security at Level 1 or higher
    * Update template `email-template.cr3` as appropriate, then use CRBasic
      Editor's 'Save and Encrypt...' option to save as `email_Enc.cr3`
    * Send `email_Enc.cr3` to the datalogger's CPU drive. Do **not** set 
      'Run now' or 'Run on startup' options when pushing this file
* *Required actions after deployment*
    * Reset program settings (or delete settings file from CPU drive) and
      re-program with correct site-specific values


### Enhancements

* Transition back to conditional compilation for auxiliary sensors:
  Decagon NDVI/PRI radiometers, Los Gatos N2O/CO, Picarro CO2/CH4, Huskeflux
  soil heat flux plate
    * No longer produces empty tables if sensors are not used (solves problem
      with CardConvert halting for user interaction when empty tables are
      encountered, improving automation scripts)
    * Increase available recording time by not allocating space for sensors
      which are not used
    * Can only be changed via 'Initial setup' menu or ConstTable; triggers
      recompilation
* Use boolean settings to enable/disable: cup and vane wind set, rain gage,
  soil moisture probes
    * Data tables are unchanged but if disabled, only NANs are recorded
    * Can be modified via 'Settings' menu or Public table; made effective
      by changing `save_changes` to True
* Expose program settings ("Settings" logger menu) values in Public table
  along with variable to save/apply settings
    * Allows remote modification of settings via LoggerNet Connect screen
    * Reduces memory consumption because of fewer variables being cached
      for public display
* Notify by email when program starts up or whenever test email is sent
* Exclude known-bad data from PAR sensor (0 or negative voltages)


### Other Changes

* Variables can no longer be monitored in the Public since it's repurposed for
  remote settings access
* New datalogger menu structure
    * previous top-level menu items are now under 'System Menu' submenu
    * previous 'Sensor Setup' submenu is now 'Settings' submenu
    * new submenu 'Initial Setup' contains options to enable/disable auxiliary
      sensors (described under *Enhancements* above)

20130416_MMTN
-------------

This version has the Los Gatos analyzer channels enabled; it expects analog 
voltage signals for N2O, CO and H2O.

### Known Issues

* In 'stats5/stats30' data tables, `rslt_wnd_dir` is not adjusted for sonic's
  orientation; add the sonic azimuth value to recorded WD for correct WD
    * HOW FAR BACK DOES THIS GO
    * since now recording `rslt_wnd_dir` instead of saving `wnd_dir_compass` as
      that name, the lack of compensation is important, also it means previous
      program versions are unaffected

* Revert secondary, slow scan interval 3 -> 1 sec
* Simplify processing of resultant wind direction 
    * Introduces error mentioned under Known Issues
    * Calculate directly into geo-compass (left-handed) instead of sensor 
      (right-handed) coordinates
* Soil heat flux related
    * Comment out data tables, measurement code & processing 
    * Add framework for automatic activation based on logger serial number
    * Decrease scan frequency from 4 -> 5 seconds
    * Set sensitivity values to 0 if sensors are deactivated

> **This version is a stub branch of 20120224_LIND**

### Issues Fixed

* Correct data table reference; before this fix, since 20120215_CFNT, values
  from the T/RH probe recorded in 30-min data table were mistakenly duplicates
  of most recent 5-min period values. 


20120224_LIND
-------------

This version diverged from an earlier, unretained draft of **20120215_CFNT**. 

### Known Issues

* New `sonic_uptime` name incorrectly attached to `wnd_dir_compass` values
  while `wnd_dir_compass` name incorrectly reflects `sonic_uptime` values
* Implementation of `*_uptime` variables may have been flawed, always 
  indicating "1"

### Issues Fixed

* Update constant `SITE_PRESS` to 93.5 kPa (based on Dec 2011 - Feb 2012)
* Fix cause of `T_hmp` being 0 and `RH_hmp_Avg` being "NAN",
  which was a missing `GetRecord` statement
* In some instances, standard deviation of wind direction is reported zero, or
  site azimuth is recorded as wind direction because period lacked data and
  mean wind direction was reported zero. To resolve both, new value 
  `sonic_uptime` tracks ratio (0-1) of good sonic records out of queries; when
  value < 0.5 then null values ("NAN") are recorded for wind stats
* Use an `irga_uptime` analagous to sonic_uptime to set `Xc`/`Xv` to null
  value ("NAN") when irga_uptime < 0.5

### Data Table Changes

* Units are changed for several columns:
    * diag_sonic: arb -> bitmap
    * diag_irga: arb -> bitmap
    * CO2_sig_strgth: arb -> unity
    * H2O_sig_strgth: arb -> unity
* Modify both 5- and 30-min tables by
    * Adding columns: sonic_uptime, CO2_ppm_Std, H2O_g_kg_Avg, H2O_g_kg_Std,
      amb_tmpr_Avg, irga_samples_Tot, irga_uptime, e_hmp_Avg, e_sat_hmp_Avg,
      hmp_uptime, Met1_uptime

### Other Changes

* Updated calibration constants to reflect LIND-specific sensors
    * net radiometer (NR-Lite2): 12.6
    * PAR sensor (LI190SB): 6.84
* Modify multiplier used to value specified in user manual (0.799 -> 0.7989)
* Redefine several variables as Public to facilitate troubleshooting
* Modify behavior for cup & vane measurement QC
    * Change `If WS=0.2811 Then WS=0` to `If WS<=0.2811 Then WS=NAN`
    * Change `If WD>=360 Then WD=0` to `If WD>=360 OR WD<0 Then WD=NAN`

20111121_LIND
-------------

> **This is a stub branch of 20111101_CFNT**

This is the first release deployed at the Lind, WA site.

### Site-specific Changes 

* Update net radiometer sensitivity value
* Update PAR sensor sensitivity value


20111101_CFNT
-------------

**This release aggregates change made over three distinct deployed versions.
The intermediate work is unrecoverable.**

### Other Changes

* Add support for Los Gatos N2O/CO analyzer and Picarro CH4/CO2 analyzer but
  leave not enabled
* Remove support for ATI sonic anemometer, which had been disabled anyway
* Remove cruft associated with unused sensors


20111011_CFNT
-------------

**This release aggregates changes made over three distinct deployed versions.
The intermediate work is unrecoverable.**

### Issues fixed

* Change UTC offset from Central Standard (-6) to Pacific Standard (-8)
  *The precise time this change occurred has not been determined, though
  it may possibly be deduced from collected data.*
* Introduce 4 diagnostic flags for ATI sonic anemometer, one per data value
  Previous parsing method only retained final flag (`Ts` value)
* Temperature is now treated correctly in calculation of `Xc` and `Xv`

### Known Issues

* Variable `ati_azimuth` is declared twice and units are misspelled ("degress")
* Monin-Obukhov Length (`L`) is calculated using the variable `Tc_mean`, which
  is the mean "corrected" temperature from the CSAT3 sonic anemometer during
  the *last processed* half-hour period (30-60m prior), not the most recent
  half-hour period.
* Incorrect temperature is used when calculating `CO2_li_um_m`, `H2O_li_um_m`.
  *This mimics an earlier fix which, in this context, is an error.*

### Data Table Changes

* Fast time series: ts_data
    * Add inst. molar density and mixing ratio of CO2 & H2O
      (co2_molar_density, h2o_molar_density) 
      (present but commented out: CO2_mix_ratio, H2O_mix ratio)
    * Added but not enabled:
        * Instantaneous U/V/W/Ts from ATI sonic (atiUx, atiUy, atiUz, atiTs)
* Half-hour statistics: flux
    * Add Monin-Obukhov length (L) *See note under Known Issues*
    * Remove naive mean of WS for cup & vane (WS_ms)
    * Add field names and units to mean WS/WD, WD stdev for cup & vane
      (034b_ws, 034b_wd, 034b_stdwd)
    * Added but not enabled:
        * ATI sonic azimuth (ati_azimuth)
        * mean WS, mean WD, WD stdev, mean U/V/W/Ts for ATI sonic
          (ati_ws, ati_wd, ati_stdwd, atiUavg, atiVavg, atiWavg, atitmpavg)

### Other Changes

* ATI sonic anemometer
    * Do not open com port at start-up (no real change since not enabled)
    * Move input from COM1 to COM3
    * Calculate instanteous WS/WD for use in half-hour table stats
* Soil heat flux plates
    * Reduce number of soil heat flux plates from 4 -> 2
    * Add actual sensor-specific sensitivity values
* Cup & vane wind sensor
    * Change wind speed units from "meters/second" -> "m/s"


20110819_CFNT
-------------

* Initial version deployed
* Modified from original work by Campbell Scientific to also record data from
  Applied Technology Inc (ATI) sonic anemometer

### Known Issues

* Wrong time zone specified: Central Standard (-6) not Pacific Standard (-8)
* Only final ATI diagnostic word retained, first three are discarded 
* Temperature incorrectly subjected to unit conversion in calculation of `Xc`
  and `Xv`
